                <p><strong>Incident:</strong> Reported by Anonymous</p>
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> I faced a harassment attack near GSU last evening. A man started following me from the campus library and made several inappropriate comments. I tried to ignore him, but he continued following me for a few blocks until I entered a well-lit area with more people around. It was really scary, and I felt unsafe. Thankfully, I was able to get help from a nearby security guard. Please be cautious when walking alone near that area, especially during late hours.</p>

                <p><strong>Incident:</strong> Reported by Anonymous</p>
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> Last week, I noticed some suspicious activity near the campus parking lot. There was a group of people loitering around late at night, and they seemed to be watching students as they walked to their cars. It made me uncomfortable, and I quickly left the area. I hope campus security can keep an eye on that spot.</p>

                <p><strong>Incident:</strong> Reported by Anonymous</p>
                <p><strong>Details:</strong> I was approached by an unknown person on the main road near GSU. He tried to ask personal questions and got too close, making me feel uncomfortable. I kept walking, but he continued to follow me for a short distance. I was able to enter a nearby building and wait until he left. This experience made me realize how vulnerable we can be in these situations. Be alert and stay safe, everyone!</p>
